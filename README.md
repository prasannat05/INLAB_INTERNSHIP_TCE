## 📌 This repository showcases two machine learning–based internship projects built at **Thiagarajar College of Engineering**:

1. 🛒 **Dynamic Price Prediction System** – An intelligent pricing engine for e-commerce sellers using XGBoost + ARIMA.
2. 🩺 **Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning** – A diagnostic tool for breast cancer using multiple ML classifiers and hybrid combinations.

These projects reflect the use of data science, predictive modeling, web development, and ML system integration to solve real-world challenges in e-commerce and healthcare.
